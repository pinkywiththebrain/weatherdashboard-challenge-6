# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this challenge I was required to make a weather dashboard app using the Open Weather API. Users can search for their city in the search bar and it fetches the current days weather as well as the 5-day forecast. Each search the user makes is saved to local storage and displayed on the page under search history. This challenge really helped me understand how to fetch specific information from an API and use it in my applications.
